Place bet or cash out

     if cashing out, check to add to high scores

     else if placing bet, make sure bet is not larger than cash remaining

          deal player and house hands

               check for naturals

                    if both have naturals, return bet and start over

                    if player has natural and house doesn't, player gets 1.5x the bet

                    if house has natural and player doesn't, house collects bet and hand is over

               play the hand: hit or stand (enable keyboard shortcuts and buttons)

                    if player total === 9, 10 or 11, option to double down

                         -> When the player's turn comes, he places a bet equal to the original bet, and the dealer gives him just one card, which is placed face down and is not turned up until the bets are settled at the end of the hand.

                    if hitting, add a new card from the deck

                         if player has ace and score goes over 21, set the value of the ace from 11 to 1

                         if player goes over 21, hand ends and player loses bet

                    if standing, play moves to the dealer

               dealer play: if score is under 17, hit else if score is 17 or above, stand

                    if hitting, add a new card from the deck

                         if house has ace and score goes over 21, set the value of the ace from 11 to 1

                         if house goes over 21, don't hit again

                         if score is still under 17, hit again

               settling: player wins bet if( player is 21 or under and house is over 21 ) else if( player and house are both 21 or under and tie, then bet is returned) else house wins
