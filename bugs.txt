*Bugs*

Player starts with 2 aces, total score = 22 but should equal 12

House draws Ace later, but it doesn't go down to 1, just stays at 11 and house Busts

Fix Cash Out button which doesn't do anything yet

Sometimes score/winner checks twice, so a losing $100 bet incorrectly deducts $200


Sometimes the Player draws an extra card when it should have only drawn one



*Possibly Fixed*

Sometimes the House draws an extra card when it should have busted already


*Definitely Fixed*
