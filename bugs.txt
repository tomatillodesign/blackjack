*Bugs*

Player starts with 2 aces, total score = 22 but should equal 12
Fix Cash Out button which doesn't do anything yet
House natural winning hand missing nextHand / cashOut buttons
Sometimes the Player draws an extra card when it should have only drawn one





*Possibly Fixed*


Sometimes score/winner checks twice, so a losing $100 bet incorrectly deducts $200, same with winning bet
     - Stand, win, House busted = OK
     - Stand, win, closer to 21 than House = OK
     - Stand, lose, house closer to 21 = OK

House draws Ace later, but it doesn't go down to 1, just stays at 11 and house Busts



*Definitely Fixed*

Sometimes the House draws an extra card when it should have busted already
