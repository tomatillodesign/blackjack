*Bugs*

Player starts with 2 aces, total score = 22 but should equal 12
House draws Ace later, but it doesn't go down to 1, just stays at 11 and house Busts
Fix Cash Out button which doesn't do anything yet
Sometimes score/winner checks twice, so a losing $100 bet incorrectly deducts $200, same with winning bet
House natural winning hand didn't deduct from player's cash



*Possibly Fixed*

Sometimes the House draws an extra card when it should have busted already
Sometimes the Player draws an extra card when it should have only drawn one



*Definitely Fixed*
